## Description

Interdisciplinary Team Project is an advanced course in the Emerging Media Technology program that provides an opportunity for students to apply the skills they've acquired in the course of pursuing their degree to a collaboratively designed and implemented project suitable for deployment in the real world.

NOTE: the project created in class will be displayed in the Emerging Media Technology Spring Show on May 2019. All work must be completed and tested well before this deadline.

## **Project Development**

Students will assess their collective skills and develop ideas for a number of candidate projects that leverage their skills. With the help of the professor, candidate projects will be evaluated.
Projects must be within budget, using the materials readily available within the Entertainment
Technology department; projects must be sufficiently ambitious, but not so ambitious that they cannot be accomplished within one semester; projects must leverage the existing skills of the students in the class, and provide opportunities for participation by everyone -- this does not, however, mean those unfamiliar technologies must be excluded.

Once candidate projects are selected, they will be winnowed by absolute veto -- that is, anyone in the class has the ability to veto any project without contest. This ensures that no one is forced to work on a project in which they have little interest. If the winnowing process removes all proposed projects, another brainstorming session takes place. After a winnowing process, if more than one project remains, each person votes for his/her favorite. The professor reserves the right to break a tie that may occur at this point.

## **Process**

The first five weeks will be directed, with specific individual assignments. After that, the class will adopt a format of biweekly sprints. 

Every two weeks a new benchmark will be established by the students, in consultation with the professor. The benchmark represents a subset of goals for the overarching project that must be accomplished within the two-week "sprint." All project participants will have tasks during the sprint, and the students themselves will document these on Github. GitHub will be used to manage software, design, and documentation versioning for the project. Each participant will push completed work to their own copy of the development branch and open a PR (pull request).
A "landmaster," typically one of the more experienced coders in the class, will evaluate the pull request. The professor may also evaluate the pull request. If comments are given, requesting changes, the committer will be required to fix and push to his/her remote copy of the branch until the work is considered complete. Each day we will have a brief standup meeting to determine where we are, individually and as a group.

## **Grading**

**10 percent of the final grade:** Participation in a stand-up meeting during the first five minutes of each class; graded on a pass/fail basis.

**65 percent of the final grade:** At the end of each two-week sprint, each individual will
demonstrate his/her work to the professor and evaluate the degree to which they have met the goals the group collectively agreed were the individual's responsibility for that sprint. A letter grade will be assigned based on the progress made toward full competition of sprint tasks.

**25 percent of the final grade:** Students must install a functioning version of the final project in the MTEC Spring Show; graded on a pass/fail basis.

## Grading Rubric

| Value | Excellent | Good | Fair | Poor | Unsatisfactory | 
|-------|-----------|------|----|----|----|
| Concept |Core concept is intriguing, original, and well-explored |Core concept is intriguing but lacking in examination | Core concept is present and supported by the work |Core ideas are scattered without consideration |No clear concept, or work doesn’t reflect it |
| Progress |Clear and consistent progress from ideation to execution|Progress was made, but was not consistent| Evidence of procrastination, “last minute” pushes or crunch|	Lack of progress in 1-2 areas resulting in project deficiencies|	Little to no progress shown on the project|
|Presentation|Concept is clearly presented and strongly supported through audio, visuals, interaction, and narrative (if applicable)|	Concept is supported through presentation, but 2 or more areas of the design are lacking or distracting|	Concept is weakly supported through presentation, project requirements met at a “bare minimum” level|	1-2 presentation requirements are not met.|	3+ presentation requirements are not met.|
|Skills|Clear demonstration of skills in all development areas (visual, text, audio, interaction, programming)|	Clear demonstration of skill in 2+ development areas	|Demonstrates skills, but omits topics covered in class.|	Evidence of skills, but underutilization of techniques learned in class|	Does not use any techniques learned in class.|
|Collaboration|Consistently provides honest, supportive feedback to peers, responsible in meeting team goals, communicates effectively.|	Generally supportive, responsible, and good communication, with a few issues|	Multiple issues/problems with collaboration, meeting goals, or communicating|	Little to no evidence of communication, goal setting, and collaboration in a team setting.|	Disrespectful to fellow students work, with negative impacts to class/team dynamics.|

## Academic Integrity Standards

Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the College recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York and at New York City College of Technology and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. The complete text of the College policy on Academic Integrity may be found in the catalog.

*Instructor’s note:* all borrowed text, code, or media used for this course must be attributed to the original creator. Any direct text quotes from another source must be specified with quotes and appropriately cited. Code borrowed from another source at more than four lines in length must be attributed as a //comment within the code itself. If you are unsure of whether or not your work may constitute plagiarism, please check with your instructor before submitting. Any instance of plagiarism will be reported to the MTEC Program Director as well as the Chair of ENT.

## Course Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, students must first be registered with the Student Support Services Program (SSSP). Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with Ms. Linda Buist, the program manager of SSSP (Phone: 718–260–5143, e-mail: [lbuist@citytech.cuny.edu](mailto:lbuist@citytech.cuny.edu)). If you have already registered with SSSP, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.

## Participation **Policy**

- Students are expected to attend every class, arrive on time, and actively engage/participate.
- **If you will be absent, or if you are running late, DM your instructor ASAP.**
- In the case of an absence, **contact a classmate for notes** and what you missed, check Github for assignments, and contact the instructor if you have additional questions.
- **All in-class activities are graded for participation**. Unexcused absences will result in a 0 for participation for the day.
- Unexcused lateness counts as 1/3 participation absence when up to 25 minutes late, 1/2 participation absence when 26-50 minutes late, and a full participation absence beyond that point.
- Participation absences may be excused in the following cases: documentation of illness provided by a doctor, religious observance with advance notice, official school-related activity (with documentation and advanced notice), and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events.
- In order to collaborate in group projects, a student must maintain a passing participation grade.
- **Midterm and Final Project critiques are mandatory** and cannot be made up. Missing a critique will result in a deduction of one letter grade for the corresponding project.
